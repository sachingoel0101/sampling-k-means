Order of files you need go through:

Point.cpp: Contains an abstraction of the data structure Point. Handles all distance calculations, addition of point, etc.

Resource.cpp: Handles a pool of Points. Can be from a data file or an already parsed data file from a vector of Points. Provides an iterator type access to the data using next_point function

Sampling.cpp: Samples from a resources a) Uniform samples b) D2-samples 
The serial version of this is in Serial_sampling.cpp 

Heuristic.cpp: Pass it a mutiset sampled using the Sampling.cpp and it returns a mean heuristic based center.
Serial version is in Serial_heuristic.cpp

Cluster.cpp: Initialize a cluster with some means, a data pool and just iterate for Lloyd.
Serial version is in Serial_cluster.cpp

main.cpp: Does an initialization and runs lloyd's algorithm. Default convergence criteria is that no more than 0.1% points change their assignments. Feel free to change it.
This is compiled in the makefile as cluster_parallel and cluster_serial using appropriate parallelization files.
Mode of running is this:

./cluster_parallel <mode> <data path> <number of clusters> <size of multiset (needed only for mode "mean")>
where mode can be random, kmeans++  and mean. 

./cluster_serial <mode> <data path> <number of clusters> <size of multiset (needed only for mode "mean")>
where mode can be random, kmeans++  and mean. 

run.cpp: This runs five initialization all in one file. random, kmeans++, mean with N=500, 1000 and 1500
Also, inside the code, you can change how many times they're run to do a variance analysis. Right now, the value is set to 5.
Also, feel free to change the convergence criteria as you wish.
Mode of running is this:
./parallel <file_name> <num_cluster>
./serial <file_name> <num_cluster>

Note that, you must keep the data in ../data/* with name as file_name. 
Also, keep ready a directory ../logs/ for placing all the logs of all the runs. The format of name of log files is described in run.cpp itself.


An example:
Suppose we have this hierarchy:

data
----mnist
----cifar

code
----makefile
----*
----parallel
----serial
----cluster_parallel
----cluster_serial

logs
----*


Then, we would run as:

./cluster_parallel random ../data/mnist 10 
./cluster_parallel kmeans++ ../data/mnist 10 
./cluster_parallel mean ../data/mnist 10 500
 and similarly for cluster_serial

 Also,
 ./parallel mnist 10
 ./parallel cifar 10

 and similarly for serial
